# Odin-Calculator
Make a calculator using HTML, CSS and JS. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

This is finished now. The thing i struggled with the most was the Javascript once again, everytime i added something new there are always bugs, the huge amount of "if" you see in the code was me trying to make everything behave.

Also i just now learned you can use Github Pages to make an accessible website for your project, so here is the link for this one: https://khufulintalou.github.io/Odin-Calculator/
